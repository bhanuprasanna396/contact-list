## Deployment
Deployed on Vercel: [Live Demo](https://contact-list-app.vercel.app) (replace with your actual URL).

## Assumptions
- Contacts are stored in local state (resets on refresh). For persistence, integrate a backend API.
- Basic validation on add form; no advanced error handling.

## Improvements
- Add local storage or backend API for persistent data.
- Include profile pictures for contacts.
- Add sorting/filtering options (by name or recently added).
- Integrate theme switch (dark/light).
